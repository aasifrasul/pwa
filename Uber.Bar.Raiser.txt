Problem Statement:
Microsoft Teams had an existing "Feeds & Notifications" section that displayed real-time updates for logged-in users (mentions, likes on comments, etc.). The product team wanted to expand this capability to show personalized feeds based on user interests, similar to LinkedIn feeds, requiring integration with an LLM model for personalization.

Initial Requirements:
Create a new page to display personalized content feeds
Integrate with an LLM model that would analyze user preferences
Display the latest five feeds with infinite scrolling for additional content,
These feeds were shortened with a link to the actual story.
It also had like/dislike option to enhance the LLM Model
Support across multiple platforms (Web, Desktop, Mobile)

Cross-Functional Complexity
The project involved multiple teams across different geographical locations:

Web, Desktop, and Mobile client teams
LLM Model team
Personalization team
Data handling team

Initial Implementation & Challenges
Our first implementation was straightforward:

Add a navigation link to the "Discover Surface"
Fetch personalized feeds data from the LLM API, and saved it to localStorage.
Display feeds with infinite scrolling

Key Challenge: The LLM API had a 7-second response time, creating a poor user experience.
Iterative Solutions
Phase 1: Client-Side Optimizations
We implemented several front-end optimizations:

Prefetched data before users navigated to the page
Showed cached data while fetching fresh content in the background
Added a "New feeds available" button when fresh content was received.
Prefetched two additional pages of data to improve scrolling experience
Implemented a 5-minute polling mechanism to fetch updated content
Added a retry mechanism with 3 attempts using linear backoff for resilience against API failures
Persisted feed data in localStorage to maintain user experience during connectivity issues

New Challenge: The Mobile team objected to the polling mechanism due to battery drain concerns, creating divergence between clients.
Phase 2: Refined Polling Strategy
To address platform-specific concerns:

Modified the polling to only occur when users were actively on the personalized feeds page
This compromise was accepted by the Mobile team

Continued Challenge: The LLM team reported they couldn't significantly reduce response time as they needed to run the model against the entire dataset.
Phase 3: Architecture Review & Optimization
After reviewing the architecture, I identified several issues:

We were fetching duplicate data frequently
The 5-minute polling interval was too short for users (unnecessary data fetching).
So I proposed to increse the time say 15/30 mins.
But Product insisted it as necessary for power users (target audience).


Polling was inefficient and resource-intensive, especially for mobile devices

I proposed a lightweight API to check for updates before fetching full data, but the LLM team explained that even this check would require running the full model.
Final Solution: Middleware Architecture
A this time it was very obvious we need a middleware to do all this heavylifting

Engaged the Java team to develop a middleware solution
After brainstorming on couple of options, we zeroed on Middleware would build and maintain personalized feed caches.
Client UIs would request data from middleware instead of directly from LLM
But ran to a raodblock, creatiing cache for each and every user would require alot of infrastructure, and not all users will be using this feature.

I propsoed Cahce generation would only occur for users who visited the page at least once

But Cold starts would still be slow (7 seconds), which product team found unacceptable.
Final Architecture
We arrived at an elegant solution:

Split the page into two tabs:

Default tab: Displayed immediately available relevant data
Second tab: Showed the personalized feeds

Implemented intelligent event-driven architecture:

UI signals when a user lands on the primary page to trigger middleware cache preparation
Middleware independently refreshes data at appropriate intervals based on user context
Server-Sent Events (SSE)/WebSockets replaced polling, allowing middleware to push notifications about new content
UI only needed to provide presence cues (which tab/page the user was viewing)
Middleware handled all data refresh logic and proactively notified clients when new data was available

This solution eliminated unnecessary polling and significantly improved the system:

Product team got fast initial page load
Power users received real-time personalized content updates without polling overhead
Mobile team's battery concerns were fully addressed with server-initiated updates
Network traffic was reduced by eliminating redundant requests
User experience remained responsive across all platforms

Additional Improvements & Future Considerations
While our solution effectively addressed the initial requirements and challenges, several potential improvements could be considered:

Advanced Caching Strategy:

Implement predictive caching based on user activity patterns
Explore differential updates to reduce payload size when synchronizing

Performance Optimizations:

Adopt a more efficient data serialization format to reduce payload size
Expand server-sent events/WebSockets capabilities for other real-time features
Implement content compression for data transfers


Scalability Enhancements:

Batch processing feeds for users in similar interest groups
Implement horizontal scaling for the middleware layer with distributed caching


User Experience Refinements:

Add user controls for feed refresh frequency based on their preferences
Implement progressive loading with content prioritization to show most relevant items first


Analytics & Monitoring:

Add telemetry to track load times, refresh patterns, and API reliability
Implement feedback mechanisms to improve feed relevance over time


Offline Capabilities:

Enhance the localStorage implementation with service workers for full offline experience
Provide visual indicators for content freshness


These improvements would further enhance the system's performance, reliability, and user satisfaction while maintaining the architectural boundaries established in the final solution.
Lessons Learned

Early cross-team collaboration is essential when dealing with distributed systems
Finding the right architectural boundaries can solve seemingly contradictory requirements
Proactive middleware can bridge performance gaps between frontend requirements and backend capabilities
User segmentation (power users vs. average users) should inform technical approaches
Resilience mechanisms like retries, local storage caching, and graceful degradation are crucial for enterprise applications
Event-driven architectures can significantly reduce network overhead and improve battery life
Server-initiated updates (SSE/WebSockets) are superior to polling for real-time data needs
Iterative design with continuous feedback leads to better architecture decisions


2.Impact & efficiency: 
Process Improvement & Efficiency: Can you share an example of when you identified inefficiencies in your team’s processes and implemented changes to improve productivity? What was the impact?
I was asked to look into a critical analytics issue on an e-commerce platform where 15% of 'Buy Now' click events weren't being captured. After methodical investigation, I discovered the root cause: the browser was canceling analytics requests when users navigated to different subdomains during checkout.
I thought about waiting for the request to complete and then moving to the next page, but was quickly shot down by the Product team, as Anlytics was of lower priority than the redirection.
If it slowed, the bounce rate would increase.
After carefull consideration I ended up offloading the request to Service Worker, this ensured the request would go through even if the tab was closed. 
I recognized an opportunity to address fundamental flaws in our analytics architecture. The existing system was sending fire-and-forget requests with no reliability guarantees or error handling mechanisms.
I proposed and led the development of a comprehensive analytics module built from the ground up with these key components:
Event Queue Manager: Collected and prioritized analytics events from various user interactions
Batch Processor: Optimized API calls by grouping events based on configurable time intervals and batch sizes
Robust API Client: Handled request formatting and communication with analytics endpoints
Service Worker Integration: Intercepted requests to ensure delivery even during page navigation, implementing intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff
Storage Manager: Leveraged Web Workers to persist failed requests.
Retry Manager: Pull stored evnts from Browesr persistent storage and sned to the API.
This architecture transformation resulted in near-perfect data capture accuracy (>99%), improved frontend performance by reducing API overhead, and created a unified analytics solution that worked seamlessly across web, mobile web, and native applications. The system's scalability also allowed us to capture more detailed event data, enhancing our ability to make data-driven product decisions.



Cross-Team Collaboration: Describe a time when you played a key role in streamlining a cross-team project or initiative. How did you approach it, and what were the results?
I was approached by a manager from another team to help streamline their release process. After analyzing their situation, I found several critical issues:

Four separate applications with different codebases
No staging environment for pre-release testing
Lack of automated tests
No standardized release process
Dependency on ad-hoc support from other teams (often mine)
Manual, error-prone rollbacks

This system clearly wasn't scalable or robust, so I developed a comprehensive solution:
First, I proposed converting the architecture to a micro-frontend approach, each app covered by unit/Integration tests.
A single Node.js server serving all applications. 
I extracted duplicated UI elements across apps into a unified design system backed by Storybook for visual regression testing.
I then built a complete CI/CD pipeline with:

A staging environment for pre-release testing
Jenkins pipeline with a dropdown to select which application to deploy
Automated process to pull code from GitHub, bundle with webpack, and push static assets to CDN
PM2 process manager for near-zero downtime deployments

The architecture leveraged Node.js's non-blocking event-driven capabilities. When requests came in, the server would:

Select the appropriate shell (.hbs file) based on URL
Extract cookie details
Fetch necessary user data
Inject data into pre-compiled shells
Return to the client

This significantly improved system reliability and scalability. We implemented:

Four AWS machines behind the Load balancer with ability to scale during high-traffic periods
Real-time load monitoring through PM2
Comprehensive telemetry and health monitoring
Automated alerts for errors and issues

The result was a dramatically more efficient, reliable release process that eliminated cross-team dependencies and improved overall product stability.


Feedback & Execution: Tell me about a project where your feedback on a plan or timeline resulted in measurable improvements in execution or outcomes. How did you approach giving the feedback?
When our e-commerce platform was planning a major analytics system upgrade, I reviewed the engineering team's initial implementation plan and timeline. Their proposal included a basic "fire-and-forget" approach for tracking user interactions, with a 6-week development timeline.

After careful analysis, I identified critical vulnerabilities in the proposed architecture - particularly that roughly 15% of purchase events would likely be lost when users navigated between subdomains during checkout. This data loss would significantly impact our ability to optimize conversion rates.

I approached giving feedback in three structured steps:

First, I validated my concerns by running tests on our staging environment that demonstrated the exact user flows where analytics data would be lost.

Second, I scheduled a collaborative meeting with the engineering and product teams rather than just submitting written feedback. During this session, I presented my findings objectively, focusing on business impact rather than technical shortcomings. I acknowledged the team's constraints while explaining how improved data accuracy would directly increase revenue.

Third, I came prepared with a comprehensive alternative solution: a robust analytics module featuring an event queue manager, batch processing, and service worker integration (with retry attempst) that would ensure near-perfect data capture even during page navigation. Storage manager to store failed Events, and a Retry Manager to re-attempt, these being behind a Web Worker to minimize the impact on Main Thread.

The team incorporated my feedback and revised their implementation plan. While this extended the timeline from 6 to 8 weeks, leadership approved the change after I demonstrated the ROI of more accurate analytics data.

The results were significant: data capture accuracy improved from an estimated 85% to over 99%, frontend performance improved due to reduced API overhead, and the unified analytics solution worked seamlessly across all platforms. Most importantly, with complete purchase funnel visibility, our marketing team optimized campaigns that increased conversion rates by 5% in the following quarter.



Problem-Solving & Project Planning: Describe a time when you resolved a project planning issue that was impeding progress. What steps did you take to address the issue, and what was the result?
While leading development of a significant feature, our team hit a roadblock regarding a complex component. We were divided on whether to build from scratch or adapt existing components. The existing code wasn't perfectly suited for our needs, but starting over would mean significant development time.
As deadlines approached and team members were occupied with other priorities, I volunteered to break this impasse. I conducted a thorough analysis of the current implementation, weighing various factors including timeline constraints, maintainability, and technical debt.
After careful consideration, I determined that refactoring the existing components was the optimal approach. While this would require some upfront investment in restructuring, it would ultimately save us time compared to rebuilding everything. I presented my analysis to the team, explaining both the technical rationale and timeline benefits.
With their support, I extracted common functionality into a higher-level abstraction layer, allowing specialized implementations to fill in the gaps as needed. I also eliminated several hardcoded conditionals that were limiting extensibility, replacing them with a more flexible design pattern. This approach made the components more adaptable for both current and future requirements.
Once the foundation was established, I created documentation and conducted knowledge-sharing sessions to ensure smooth handover to the developers who would implement the remaining pieces. I remained available for consultation and directly contributed to some of the more intricate sections.
This approach proved successful on multiple fronts: we unblocked the planning process, met our delivery timeline, and avoided creating parallel components that would have increased our maintenance burden. The refactored components have since been reused in several other features, validating our decision to invest in improving rather than replacing them.
This experience reinforced my belief in balancing pragmatism with technical excellence. Sometimes the best solution isn't starting fresh, but thoughtfully evolving what already exists.


Mentorship & Team Support: Can you give an example of when you helped a struggling team or team member improve efficiency or achieve a critical goal? What actions did you take, and what was the outcome? 
I was tasked with mentoring a junior developer who was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan. First, I created a safe environment by meeting privately and asking if she felt comfortable discussing any factors affecting her work.

When she shared that family issues were impacting her performance, I acknowledged the difficulty while establishing clear boundaries. I explained that while I couldn't directly help with personal matters, I could recommend company resources like our EAP program, and I would fully support her professional development.

We began by breaking down her assignments into smaller, manageable tasks with clear expectations and deadlines. I implemented a daily 15-minute check-in to monitor progress without micromanaging. 

My approach focused on building problem-solving skills rather than providing solutions. When she faced technical challenges with our API integration work, I asked her to articulate the issue thoroughly and outline potential solutions before offering guidance. Initially hesitant, she gradually developed confidence in her analytical abilities.

I provided constructive feedback using the "situation-behavior-impact" framework, which helped her understand specific areas for improvement while recognizing her progress. Over ten weeks, she transitioned from requiring step-by-step guidance to independently completing tasks with minimal supervision.

The outcome was significant: she successfully completed her PIP, reduced her bug rate by approximately 40%, and improved her code review response time from 3 days to 1 day. Beyond individual metrics, her increased confidence positively influenced team dynamics, particularly during our sprint planning sessions where she began actively contributing ideas.

This experience reinforced my belief that effective mentorship requires balancing support with accountability while adapting to individual learning styles.

Driving Change & Adoption: Suppose you’re tasked with standardizing a process across multiple teams to enhance efficiency and collaboration. What steps would you take to implement and gain adoption for the new process?
I'd follow a structured yet adaptable approach focused on collaboration and clear communication.
First, I'd invest time understanding the current landscape. 
I'd meet with representatives from each team to learn about their existing processes, pain points, and what's working well. 
This would give me valuable insights and help build relationships from the start. 
Based on these findings, I'd define clear objectives and success metrics for the effort.
Next, I'd form a cross-functional working group with key members from each team. Together, we'd co-create the standardized process, ensuring it addresses the challenges we identified while preserving what's already working well. 
I believe this collaborative approach creates better solutions and builds early buy-in.
For the actual implementation, I'd start with a pilot in one or two receptive teams.
If time permits I would like to do an iterative pilot on all teams starting with least affected and completing with the most affected.
This allows to face and fix challenges incrementally, instaed of getting bogged down with a large piece.
Also helps to work out issues before a broader rollout and creates success stories we can leverage. Based on the pilot feedback, we'd refine our approach and develop comprehensive training materials.
When rolling out more widely, communication would be my priority. 
I'd clearly articulate the 'why' behind the change, highlighting specific benefits for individuals and teams. 
I'd identify champions within each group who could model the new process and support their colleagues. I've found that peer advocacy is often more effective than top-down directives.
Throughout implementation, 
I'd establish multiple support channels like training sessions, documentation, and regular office hours to help teams transition. 
I'd also create opportunities to celebrate early wins and recognize teams making good progress.
Finally, I'd gather ongoing feedback and make iterative improvements. 
In my experience, no process is perfect at launch, and showing willingness to adapt based on real-world experience helps maintain credibility and momentum.
In a previous role, I used this approach when standardizing our client onboarding process across three regional teams. 
By focusing on collaboration and clear communication, we achieved 90% adoption within two months and ultimately reduced onboarding time by 40%, while improving client satisfaction scores.
